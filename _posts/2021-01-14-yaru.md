title: Desperation And Goals
---

<p class="message">
What's it like being a NEET for 2 years? Inhumane.

This is my last chance to redeem myself before I fade into oblivion. There's no one left but me.
<p>

Things I want to explore:

    1. Instrument/voice separation from audio file
    2. Voice separation from audio file with multiple people talking at once
    3. Speech to text
    4. Text to speech
    5. Combination of the above
    6. Speech synthesis

I want to get these done before the end of this year. Probably a difficult goal, but I don't even know if I have that long of a timeframe to work with. Please wish me well.
