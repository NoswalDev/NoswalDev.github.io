title: Desperation And Goals
---

<p class="message">
What's it like being a NEET for 2 years? Inhumane.

This is my last chance to redeem myself before I fade into oblivion. There's no one left but me.
<p>

<p>Things I want to explore:</p>

<ol>
<li>Instrument/voice separation from audio file</li>
<li>Voice separation from audio file with multiple people talking at once</li>
<li>Speech to text</li>
<li>Text to speech</li>
<li>Combination of the above</li>
<li>Speech synthesis</li>
</ol>

I want to get these done before the end of this year. Probably a difficult goal, but I don't even know if I have that long of a timeframe to work with. Please wish me well.
